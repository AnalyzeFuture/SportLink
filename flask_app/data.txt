SportLink – Unlocking Athletic Potential Nationwide SportLink is a software solution designed to connect athletes from remote areas of India with training institutes, professionals, and resources to enhance their skills and career opportunities. The platform leverages AI-driven personalized recommendations and skill assessments to bridge the accessibility gap in sports training. The key objectives include enabling athletes to find and connect with relevant coaches, training centers, and mentors, providing tailored training recommendations based on athlete performance, skill level, and goals, ensuring athletes from underserved areas can access training opportunities, using AI to evaluate an athlete’s skills and suggest areas of improvement, and implementing interactive features, analytics, and a community-driven platform for enhanced user engagement. The technical components involve machine learning models such as TfidfVectorizer for text processing, Logistic Regression for classification, and XGBoost Regression for performance prediction. Data challenges include handling outliers and variance, addressing noise in data, and preventing overfitting and underfitting for accurate predictions. Additionally, the system incorporates a personalized diet recommendation feature using ML to suggest nutrition plans tailored to individual athletes. Sentiment analysis for comments has been developed separately and is currently being merged into the main system. A chatbot integration is planned to provide information on Olympic games. Initial project discussions involved rejecting a personal finance project idea before finalizing SportLink, with key meetings with mentors focused on refining the concept. Literature review and design improvements include enhancing the literature review format, improving block diagrams, correcting grammatical issues, and verifying plagiarism in the abstract. The current progress includes ongoing core AI model development, with sentiment analysis requiring final integration. Upcoming enhancements include implementing chatbot functionality, improving efficiency in AI predictions, and later integrating MongoDB for scalable data storage and retrieval. SportLink aims to revolutionize access to sports training in India by combining AI, ML, and a user-friendly platform to empower athletes nationwide. The project is continuously evolving with refinements based on research, technical advancements, and user feedback.
